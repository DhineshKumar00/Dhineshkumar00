        <p>A camera lens is the part of a camera that directs light to
             the film or, in a digital camera,
            <br> to a computer chip that can sense the light.
             Many cheap lenses are plastic but better ones are made from glass. 
            <br>The lens makes an image by focusing the light</p>

        What are the details of a lens?
        A lens is a piece of transparent glass which concentrates or disperses light rays when passes through them by refraction. Due to the magnifying property, lenses are used in telescopes and other magnifying devices. They are employed in cameras for gathering light rays.
